<summary style="max-width:150px;">CORRELATION</summary>
<p style=" background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">Correlation is a statistic that measures the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">KDEPLOT</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">A kernel density estimate (KDE) plot is a method for visualizing the distribution of observations in a dataset, analagous to a histogram. KDE represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">MEAN</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean, or simply the mean or the average, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">MEDIAN</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">In statistics and probability theory, the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">MODE</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">EXPECTATION</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">It is the summation or integration of a possible values from a random variable.  It is also known as the product of the probability of an event occurring, denoted P(x), and the value corresponding with the actual observed occurrence of the event.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">VARIANCE</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">It measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.</p>

<details>
<summary style="max-width:250px">STANDARD DEVIATION</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">PERCENTILE</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">A percentile is a term used in statistics to express how a score compares to other scores in the same set. While there is technically no standard definition of percentile, it's typically communicated as the percentage of values that fall below a particular value in a set of data scores.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">IQR</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">The IQR describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest. To find the interquartile range (IQR), ​first find the median (middle value) of the lower and upper half of the data. These values are quartile 1 (Q1) and quartile 3 (Q3). The IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1.  </p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">Linear Regression</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x)</p>

<summary>Simple Linear Regression</summary>
Simple linear regression lives up to its name: it is a very straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response Y on the basis of a single predictor variable X. It assumes that there is approximately a linear
relationship between X and Y . Mathematically, we can write this linear
relationship as

>Y ≈ β0 + β1X.

β0 and β1 are two unknown constants that represent
the intercept and slope terms in the linear model. Together, β0 and β1 are known as the model coefficients or parameters. Once we have used our training data to produce estimates βˆ0 and βˆ1 for the model coefficients, we
can predict future sales on the basis of a particular value of TV advertising
by computing


><math> yˆ = β<sup>ˆ</sup><sub>0</sub> + β<sup>ˆ</sup><sub>1</sub>x</math>

The core idea is to obtain a line that best fits the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.
