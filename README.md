<summary style="max-width:150px">KDEPLOT</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">A kernel density estimate (KDE) plot is a method for visualizing the distribution of observations in a dataset, analagous to a histogram. KDE represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">MEAN</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean, or simply the mean or the average, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">MEDIAN</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">In statistics and probability theory, the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">MODE</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">EXPECTATION</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">It is the summation or integration of a possible values from a random variable.  It is also known as the product of the probability of an event occurring, denoted P(x), and the value corresponding with the actual observed occurrence of the event.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">VARIANCE</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">It measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.</p>

<details>
<summary style="max-width:250px">STANDARD DEVIATION</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">PERCENTILE</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">A percentile is a term used in statistics to express how a score compares to other scores in the same set. While there is technically no standard definition of percentile, it's typically communicated as the percentage of values that fall below a particular value in a set of data scores.</p>

<summary style="max-width:150px">IQR</summary>
<p style="background-color: #34a1eb; color:#141414">The IQR describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest. To find the interquartile range (IQR), â€‹first find the median (middle value) of the lower and upper half of the data. These values are quartile 1 (Q1) and quartile 3 (Q3). The IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1.  </p>
